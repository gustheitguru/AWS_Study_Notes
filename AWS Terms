S3 

Excryption In Transite - HTTPS bewteen computer and server encryption SSL/TLS

Encryption At Rest (Server Side) - 2 ways

	1) Server Side - 
		s3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 Amazon manges all keys - AES256
		AWS Key management Service - Mange keys with AWS -SSE-KMS
		Customer Provided Key - Give Amazon Key we manage - SSE-C
	2) Client Side Encryption
		encrypte file and and upload to AWS

_______________________

Versioning 

Stores all version of files

delete file - will put a delete marker on the file and use the previous version. But not remove it from the system. have to do a manual delete of the file

versioning can not be disabled only suspended

Versioning has MFA delete capabilites. for layer of security

_______________________

Life cycle management

AWS- Bucket - Management Lifecycle

rule can be applied to current and or previous versions 

setup life cycle rules to move thigns around from different storage teirs to glacier to permetly delete it as well. 

Automate between different tiers

use it in conjunction with versioning

can be applied to current and perviouse versions of files

S3 object Lock - WORM Mobdel - can be set to file or folder (object or bucket) - Governance or compliance

store object - write once read many - helps to lock file for fixed time or indefiently. protects from objects beening changd or deleted. 

goverance mode - user can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock setting unless they have special permissions

compliance mode - a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, not even ROOT user, during time of retenetion period. 

Retention period - protect object version of a set period of time. once the object retention period is up you can then delete or change file 

legal holds - a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. no retention period remain in effect until it is removed. needs S3:PutObjectLegalHold Permission group. 

Glacier Vault lock - S3 Glacier Vault Lock allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy. You can specify controls, such as WORM (Write Once Read Many), in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed. 

__________________

S3 Multipart upload - Parallelize upload by specifying byte range. Used to speed up uploads recommend for files above 100mb and required for files over 5gb

S3 Byte-Range Fteches - Parallelize downloads by specifying byte range. Used to speed up downloads

Prefixes - path name of file name between file. More prefixes the better the porformance 3,500 PIT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per seconds

with 2 different prefixes you can get 11,000 GET/HEAD requests per second

SSE-KMS Encrypted file only allowed 5,500, 10,000, 30,000 depeneding on region

________________

S3 Select - enables applications to retrieve only a subset of data, getting data by rows and columns, from an object by using simlle SQL expressions. Retrieving only data need for app you can improve performances up to 400% and up to 80% Cheaper

Glacier Select - allows you to run SQL queries against glacier directly.

AWS Orginization - account management service that enables you to consolidate multipe aws account into an organization that you create and centrally mange.

Consolidated Billing - the more you use the less you pay. on bill per aws account volume pricing discount

_______________________

Best Practices - Multi-Factor Authentication on root account - Primary account is only for Billing not for deploymnet of services - Enable/Disable AWS Services using Service Control Policies either on OU or Individual Accounts

_______________________

S3 Buckets Accross Multiple accounts - 

3 ways to share buckets

	1) Bucket policies & IAM (Applies across the entire bucket) only GUI no CLI
	2) Bucket ACL & IAM (individual objects) Only GUI no CLI
	3) Cross-account IAM Role. Programatic and Console access

______________________

Cross Region Replication 

	1) versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination bucket
	2) files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
	3) all subsequent updated files will be reqplicated automatically
	4) delete markers are not replicated
	5) delete individual versions are not replicated
	6) understand what Cross Region Replication is at a High Level
